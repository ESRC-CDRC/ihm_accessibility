# IHM Accessibility Analysis

This repository is a collection of code required for the computation of accessibility based on bus timetables and Ordnance Survey ITN network data. The goal of the analysis is to better understand long term shifts in accessibility to key POIs such as hospital, supermarkets and retail centres.

Instructions for the computation of accessibility are provided in the project [Wiki](https://github.com/ESRC-CDRC/ihm_accessibility/wiki).

The following work has been completed as part of the Inclusive and Healthy Mobility project at UCL. For further details about the project see https://www.cdrc.ac.uk/research/healthymobility/.
